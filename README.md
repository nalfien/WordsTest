# WordsTest
Included files are an Eclipse project, and a compiled jar file.

The compiled jar file can be run as "java -jar WordsTest.jar \<dictionary file\>" where "dictionary file" is a one word per line dictionary file to be tested. The program will then generate two files in the same directory as the dictionary file, one called "sequences.txt", the other "words.txt".
