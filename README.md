# WordsTest
Included files are an Eclipse project, and a compiled jar file.

The compiled jar file can be run as "java -jar WordsTest.jar \<dictionary file\>" where "dictionary file" is a one word per line dictionary file to be tested. The program will then generate two files in the same directory as the dictionary file, one called "sequences.txt", the other "words.txt".

Also included are a set of test cases, testing the following cases in the word process function:

-Empty string

-Single sequence

-Single word, single sequence

-Duplicate sequence
